### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jack Purkiss

- I've recently graduated from MSc Computer Animation and Visual effects from Bournemouth University
- This year, I'm taking some time to travel, while I work on building my portfolio
- Take a look at my [website](https://jack3761.github.io/) or check all my links at [linktr.ee/jackpurkiss](https://linktr.ee/jackpurkiss)
- I love to build tools for DCC packages, particularly Houdini, Maya and Unreal Engine. Take a look at my [masters project](https://github.com/jack3761/UE-UsdAttributeTool) where I developed a set of USD tools for Unreal Engine
